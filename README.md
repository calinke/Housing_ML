Kaggle Ames Housing Competition

"v2" - my first completed model for the Kaggle 'Housing Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition. Public score: 0.15513

"v3-No pipeline" - a second attempt at some model improvement. Utilized 'Dabl' to help clean and understand the train df. Did not use scikit-learn pipelines in preperation. Continue to struggle with some mis-match in train and test df after running get_dummies(). However, this model did perform better thn v2. Public score 0.14788
